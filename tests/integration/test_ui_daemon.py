"""Real-subprocess integration test for `ui_daemon.py`.

Spawns the actual daemon script under this plugin's own interpreter — the
same way `karcytics_sdk.plugin.PluginUIDaemon` does from the Hub — and speaks
its real msgpack-over-stdio protocol. No mocking of the daemon itself: this
is what proves the module can be hosted standalone (`process_model =
"isolated"`), not just that its Python imports resolve.
