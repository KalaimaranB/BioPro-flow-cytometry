"""Population identity matching across samples.

Backs the shared sample/population selector (ui/widgets/selection/) used by
the Statistics and Comparisons tabs: given the set of currently checked
samples, partition each sample's gated populations into those present under
the same name in *every* sample ("shared" — the result of group gate
propagation) versus those unique to one sample. Kept free of Qt imports so it
can be unit tested without a QApplication.

This also replaces three independent copies of the same label-path
composition that used to live in StatisticsExplorer._compute_results,
ComparisonsViewer._build_render_kwargs, and GroupPreviewPanel._get_parallel_node.

    Known limitation, not fixed here: matching is by display-label text, not
    a stable cross-sample population ID. Gate propagation
    (analysis/gate_propagator.py) rebuilds a fresh GateNode per target sample
    from a serialized dict rather than sharing a reference, so a gate renamed
