"""Real emission-spectrum overlap math.

Shared between the Spectral Viewer's overlap-highlighting (`spectral_viewer.py`)
and the interactive "Learning Compensation" teaching widget
(`spectral_learning_tab.py`), so both surfaces report the same number for the
same pair of dyes.

The overlap % is a Bhattacharyya-style normalized integral of two dyes'
*emission curves* — a theoretical estimate of how much one dye's light could
leak into another's detector based on published spectra alone. This is
distinct from `compensation.calculate_spillover_matrix`, which measures
spillover empirically from real single-stain event data (detector gain,
laser power, and filter bandpass all shift the real value away from this
theoretical one).
