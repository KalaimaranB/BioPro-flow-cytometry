"""Declarative per-plot-type contract for the Comparisons tab.

Before this module, "what a plot type needs" was implicitly spread across
four independent places: ``PLOT_REGISTRY`` (renderer/options panel classes),
``PLOTS_MULTI_POPULATION``, ``PLOTS_MULTI_CHANNEL``, ``PLOTS_WITHOUT_CHANNEL_LIST``
(three separate membership sets), and a hand-written ``if/elif`` chain in
``ComparisonsViewer._build_render_kwargs``. Registering a new plot type in
one place without remembering all the others compiled and ran fine — it just
crashed at render time with something like ``KeyError: 'base_x'`` the moment
a user actually generated that plot, because the kwargs-building branch for
it silently didn't exist.

``PlotTypeSpec`` bundles all of that into one required, typed record per
plot type: sample/population/channel constraints AND the function that
builds renderer kwargs from a selection. Since every field is required,
Python itself refuses to construct an incomplete spec — the missing-branch
bug this module replaces cannot compile silently again.
